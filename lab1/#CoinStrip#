 *Name: Alvaro Aleman
 *Lab: 1- Silver Dollar Game
 *This class is esigned to implement a text version of the Silver ollar Game. A Strip of size 15 will be represented as ab array. Empty 
 *spaces will be represented as an underscore "_" and coins will be represented as numbers. In the beginning players can determine how many coins 
 *they will play with or can choose to play with a ranfom amount by typing a 0. Players will take turns moving coins with the form "cn, ns",
 *where cn is the coin number to be moved and ns is the number of spaces the coin should be moved to the left. 
 *Method keep track of legality of moves, update the array keeping track of positions, display the string representation of the array, and 
 *end the game once all coins have made it to the left. 
 *
 *Thought Questions. 
 *1.One way to approach this is to allocate a range of numbers to represent a certain number of coins once a random number is acquired. 
 * For example, if we compute a random number between 0 and 10 then we can code it so that if the random number falls between 0 and 5,
 * then three coins would be placed. Likewise, between 5 and 7.5 would place four coins, and between 7.5 and 9 would place five coins and 
 * on. 
 *
 *2.One can guarentee no immediate wins by making sure that there are at least a couple of spaces in between the coins. To do this, when 
 *assigning the random locations for the coins one can restrict that no two are next to each using if statements and the array that keeps 
 *track of coin locations. 
 *
 *3.The computer could suggest when to move a coin beside the next one. This limits the possible moves a player's  opponent can have since coins 
 *can only move in one direction. 
 *
 *4.The method would focus on moving coins so that there are an even number of possible moves left after the move. This guarentees that the
 *computer has at least one more move and makes it more likely to have the final move- which wins the game. It is also easy to recognize where the game 
 *is headed once only the last two coins remain.  
 *
 *5.This rule change would not change my implementation too significantly. My testLegalMove() method has an if statement that checks whether
 *the move would move the coin to a location with a coin already there or pass the coin next to it. I would just need to change this statement
 *to allow coins to pass each other but still not land on top of each other. 
 *
 *
 *Note: The number entered at the beginning is being counted as the players first move. Since it is only a single number you will receive an illegal move method
 *and then will be able to enter the desired move. Each number on the line represents a coin and can move that number in the format #,(Spaces to move left)
